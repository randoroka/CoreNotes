# CoreNotes

## Description
CoreNotes is a simple macOS application for storing notes. This project 
is older but is still functional.

## Features
- **Authentication**: Integrated with Firebase for user authentication.
- **Note Management**: Utilizes CoreData to organize and store folders and 
notes.
- **User Interface**: Developed using SwiftUI.

## Current Status
CoreNotes is functional but still needs to be improved. I hope to improve 
the interface and potentially add some additional features.
